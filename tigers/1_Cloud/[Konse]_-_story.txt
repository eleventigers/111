First it came to my cradle to comfort and ensure to be the closest friend…

It echoes my screams and tears to raises as the shining blade for battles not to be won…

It provides as a tool to face the grudge and get resurrected anew but still the same…

It shields as a sanctuary and keeps me save guiding me to meet myself…

It surrounds me when love is embraced to maintain as the symphonie of my life…

“Without music, life would be a mistake.”
