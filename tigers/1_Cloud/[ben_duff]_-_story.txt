One day, when I was in LA back in the 80's, I saw a Hummingbird. It was beautiful, just hovering there like it was suspended by fishing line. The day before, I had called a UFO hotline in the yellow pages to report a UFO sighting I had made whilst stood in the swimming pool area of the apartment complex. I wished I hadn’t called cos from then on, I was paranoid that I was being “watched” by the FBI. Anyway, back to the hummingbird. A small fly flew towards my face and I instinctively batted it away. Unfortunately, I batted it in the direction of the Hummingbird, who, not really expecting a meal, simply parted it’s beak and the poor fly disappeared into it’s small gob. Dead FOREVER.
